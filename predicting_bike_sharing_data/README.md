# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (Your First Neural Network)

## A. Introduction

In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the  [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

## B. Instructions

1.  Download the project materials from  [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch). You can get download the repository with  `git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git`. Our files in the GitHub repo are the most up to date, so it's the best place to get the project files.
2.  cd into the  `project-bikesharing`  directory.
3.  Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the  [Anaconda lesson](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd101/parts/2a9dba0b-28eb-4b0e-acfa-bdcf35680d90/modules/aba54606-cf35-4a77-b643-efec6a90bfa1/lessons/9e9ed61d-20c3-4431-95aa-a1099f28d601/concepts/4cdc5a26-1e54-4a69-8eb4-f15e37aaab7b). These are also outlined in the repository  [README](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/README.md).
4.  Create a new conda environment:
    
    ```
    conda create --name deep-learning python=3
    
    ```
    
5.  Enter your new environment:
    -   Mac/Linux:  `>> source activate deep-learning`
    -   Windows:  `>> activate deep-learning`
6.  Ensure you have  `numpy`,  `matplotlib`,  `pandas`, and  `jupyter notebook`  installed by doing the following:
    
    ```
    conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
    
    ```
    
7.  Run the following to open up the notebook server:
    
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    
    ```
    
8.  In your browser, open  `Predicting_bike_sharing_data.ipynb`. Note that in the previous workspace this was called  `Your_first_neural_network.ipynb`  but the contents are the same, this is just a descriptive difference.
9.  Follow the instructions in the notebook; they will lead you through the project. You'll ultimately be editing the  `my_answers.py`  python file, whose components are imported into the notebook at various places.
10.  Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook and have taken a look at  [the rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2148/view)  before you submit the project!
