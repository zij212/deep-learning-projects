# Generate TV Scripts

### Introduction

In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

### Getting the project files

The project files can be found in our  [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch), in the  `project-tv-script-generation`  folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using:

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git

```

This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with  `git pull`.

You may also choose to complete your project using the provided, in-classroom project notebook; this will just require that you run the project notebook, and download the complete files, as specified below.
