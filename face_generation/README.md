# Face Generation
## Introduction
In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

## Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-face-generation), in the `project-face-generation` folder.

You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer. This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with `git pull`.
